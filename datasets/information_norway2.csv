1644,"I remember he was a calf
He often told me
Love is not what this new generation thinks
Talk to you soon and keep up the good content
These are the days of meetings
If it's all love
So love such love
Love is love
Beyond the desire for destruction and connection
He used to say
Understand when love comes close",10,0,Oslo,0.9865,
